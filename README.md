PhaROS
======

PhaROS is library and framework that allows you to write ROS nodes in the [Pharo Smalltalk language](http://www.pharo.org).

The aiming of PhaROS is to exploit the benefits of a highly dynamic image-based language (live environment) for the agile and prototype oriented development of ROS nodes and robotics solutions. Encourage code reusability and testing. An being also able to program and design in terms of high level abstractions, making possible to PhaROS to be used in robotics program- ming courses, without needing to know much about robotics in first time.

PhaROS is developed and maintained by [CAR team](http://car.mines-douai.fr) at [Ã‰cole des Mines de Douai](http://www.mines-douai.fr).
